# Othello
This is the repository for the main project I performed during my bachelor's degree at BarcelonaTech. It is an implementation of a famous game called Othello. It's implemented with Java and has a three tier architecture (logic, data and presentation). It includes:
- Source Code: src directory
- Test jars: test directory (includes integration test with drivers and stubs)
- Program jars: out/com/subgrup13
